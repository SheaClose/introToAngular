      <h1>Why Angular?</h1>
      <div class=""> Jquery's code quickly becomes complicated and hard to read. Harder to maintain</div>
      <div class="w_a_list_container">
        <div class="w_a_list">
          Angular is:
        </div>
        <ul class="w_a_list">
          <li class=""> Modular<span>- Due to seperation of concerns, you can keep your components small, focused, and thus, reusable.</span> </li>
          <li class=""> DRY <span>- Since you can reuse your code, you do not constantly repeat yourself.</span></li>
          <li class=""> Readable <span>- No more spaghetti code, everything in it's place.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

  <div class="spa_container">
    <div class="w_a_body">
      <h1>SPA Framework</h1>
      <div class=""> SPA stands for Single Page Application. This means the entire Application takes place on a single URL. </div>
      <div class="w_a_list_container">
        <div class="w_a_list">
          This is awesome because:
        </div>
        <ul class="w_a_list">
          <li class=""> No more page re-loads during standard navigation and for EVERY user interaction.</li>
          <li class=""> More responsive - Page reacts similarly to native aplication.</li>
          <li class=""> Increased performance - becuase the HTML is sent in the initial request, only data is requested from servers, decreasing load time for each state change.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="w_a_list">
          Negatives:
        </div>
        <ul class="w_a_list">
          <li class=""> Increased intial load time. Because we are loading everything up front, the initial load time is slightly increased. </li>
          <li class=""> SEO - Until very recently, search engines like Google and Bing had a difficult time crawling and indexing Single Page Applications. </li>

      <h1>MVC</h1>
      <div class=""> MVC Stands for Model View Controller. MVC is an architectual concept that is not specific to Angular. </div>

        <ul class="w_a_list">
          <li class="">The Model represents the business logic of your app</li>
          <li class="">The View is the app as displayed to the user.</li>
          <li class="">The Controller is what handles the modification of the model and the view based on user interaction. We will have access to the Controller from the DOM via "$scope".</li>

    <div class="directives_container">
      <h1>Angular Directives</h1>
      <div class=""> Directives are very powerful, and handle the majority of the work for us. They allow us to establish links between the View and the Model. Directives have the ability to execute methods, define behavior, attach controllers and $scope objects, manipulate
        the DOM, and more. </div>
      <div class="w_a_list_container">
        <div class="w_a_list">
          Directives:
        </div>
        <ul class="w_a_list">
          <li class=""> ng-app - It is added to set the AngularJS section. Any HTML element that is a child of this directive will be part of our Application. Should be set as a high-level Element (HTML/Body).</li>
          <li class=""> ng-controller - It is used to attach a controller class to the view. This attribute sets which controller (and thus which $scope) our data is bound to.</li>
          <li class=""> ng-click - It is used to execute a method or expression when element is clicked. Most commonly used on buttons, though it can be added to ANY HTML element.</li>
          <li ng-style="myStyle"> ng-style - It is used to set CSS style on an HTML element conditionally.<button type="button" name="button" ng-click="!myStyle  ? myStyle = {'background-color':'yellow'} : myStyle = null">Style</button></li>
          <li class=""> ng-model - It is used to bind an input,select, textarea etc to a property on the $scope. <input type="text" ng-model="myInput" name="" value="">
          </li>
          <li class="ng_model_display"> Diplay for ng-model: {{myInput}} </li>
          <li class=""> ng-repeat - It is used to loop through each item in collection to create a new template. </li>
          <li class="" ng-hide="show"> ng-show/ng-hide - It workes based on expression, if true then the element is shown or hidden respectively. <button type="button" ng-click="show = !show">Hide Me!</button>
          </li>
          <button type="button" ng-show="show" ng-click="show = !show">Show Me!</button>
          <li class=""> ng-if - It is used to remove or recreate an element in the DOM depending on an expression. This differs from show/hide in that with show/hide, the element is on the DOM, but is set to "display: none". With ng-if, if the provided expression does
            not evaluate to true, the element is not rendered to DOM at all.</li>
